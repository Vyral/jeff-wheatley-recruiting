<p>Dear Fellow Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>I understand that you may be in the early stages of your career as a real estate agent or you’re someone who has yet to enter the world of real estate but wishes to pursue a career in this business.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have much to bring to the table: a can-do attitude and a track record of excellence. It could be that you have clearly defined, but realistic, goals and you place emphasis on having the energy and empathy to serve clients on a more personal level.  </p>

<p>Like so many new agents, you probably have the willpower and drive to succeed but don’t know how to get there—you may find yourself struggling to create sufficient cash flow, fearing failure, and realizing that you haphazardly decided to get into real estate with no real plan for success. To make matters worse, you haven’t been able to establish an identity, as an agent, that differentiates you from the competition, nor is anyone really keeping you accountable to those things.</p>

<p><strong>Sadly, in terms of the national numbers, 87% of agents will fail within their first five years working in the industry.</strong> The main catalyst for failure is the fact that agents often arrive looking for “silver bullet” solutions—they attempt to buy their own leads or jump ship for a brokerage that will supply them with leads where there’s no push for them to be earned.    </p>

<p>If you’re one of these agents, your goals are likely seeming less and less reachable by the day. Wondering where your next deal is going to come from and how you’ll be able to generate steady cash flow is keeping you at 3 a.m. Another uncomfortable thought is that you’ve potentially become reliant on your spouse’s income as your own production continues to wane and this is wearing on you.  </p>

<p>You know that the clock is ticking and changes need to be made. Otherwise, you risk seeing your career go on floundering, not seeing the growth and independence you’re after, and exiting this line of work in defeat and carrying debt.</p>

<p>Let me first introduce myself: I’m Jeff Wheatley, and I’ve been in the business for a little over a decade now. When I got my start in 2007, the market was tanking. Nevertheless, I jumped in feet first and taught myself how to short sell business. <strong>I was so successful in this endeavor that I traveled across Maryland going from one Keller Williams office to another teaching fellow agents how to short sell.</strong></p>

<p>From there, I became an early adopter of pay-per-click lead generation and closed almost $250,000 GCI in my second year on this side of the business. I followed a new path not long after and closed over 25 expired listings transactions in a single year.  </p>

<p><strong>So if what I’ve detailed above sounds familiar to your situation and you’re ready to see forward momentum in your career, let’s have a conversation about you becoming a member of my team.</strong>  </p>

<p>Having the proper work ethic and desire to succeed as an agent is just the start—you’ll need a plan and vision for growth with continued guidance. To that end, we’ll work together to help you create an achievable plan where daily accountability and coaching are at the forefront of our approach.</p>

<p>Here, you’ll learn the discipline and skills necessary to self-generate business, effectively putting you in control as you grow. You’ll also have access to the full breadth of my systems and resources so that you can allocate all of your time and energy toward lead generation.</p>

<p>Some of those resources that an agent who teams up with me will have access to are:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Personalized coaching </li>
<li>Insight and expertise on script mastery </li>
<li>Success tools such as Mojo</li>
Teaching you the requisite skills to become a business owner in two to three years
</ul></p>

<p>Working on my team means you’ll earn the money, control, and freedom that come with developing a well-designed plan and as you continue to strengthen your skills and knowledge as a sales and marketing professional. <strong>If there’s one thing I’m known for, it’s that I teach people how to think a little differently about their business.</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, your success or failure in real estate rests squarely on your shoulders. You can stay the course as a solo agent or fall for the pitch other teams make about Facebook leads that don’t show much promise to begin with and may not come through. Doing so will likely lead to a fast exit or failure to make much of a living.</p>

<p>But don’t just take my word for it: Alec was a 19-year-old fresh out of high school when he came to me looking to land an opportunity. He didn’t have any business skills whatsoever, let alone in business management. Over a short period, we taught him how to set expired listing appointments at $300,000 and then eventually as much as $1.5 million. Relative to his age, Alec then learned to convert in face-to-face appointments at a very impressive level. He has since parted ways with us due to a family move, but today he works for a top 10 Berkshire Hathaway team.</p>

<p>When you join our team, you’ll benefit from a 50/50 commission split right from the outset, and you won’t have to worry about marketing and transaction management—we’ll take on that responsibility for you. <strong>This way, our mutual goal will be to scale your earnings from 50% all the way up to 75%.</strong>  </p>

<p>Then, the process of onboarding will include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Teaching you how to think like a top-sale professional</li>
<li>Shadowing and mimicking me as I go through the sales process</li>
<li>After three weeks, you’ll lead the process</li>
<li>You’ll continue the process and we tweak your approach</li>
</ol></p>

<p>In the face of the current market shift where lower commissions are a certainty, this opportunity could not come at a better time, so don’t let it pass you by. <strong>There’s no telling how much you can benefit from joining my team now and staying ahead of the highest number of competitors we’ve seen in our market since 2006,</strong> so please reach out today.  </p>


<p>I very much look forward to speaking with you soon!</p>

<p>Jeff Wheatley</p>
